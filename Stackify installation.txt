*  New Relic provides a setup of real-time instrumentation and analytics.


* Scout APM provides detailed insights on performance directly on its dashboard. It identifies slow database queries, N+1 database queries, errors, and memory bloat.
==>  Scout provides better transaction traces by breaking down memory allocation in addition to timing metrics. Scout APM can easily backtrace slow method calls to identify performance bottlenecks and tie them to source code. 
     Database Monitoring provides charts to display data across each query (not just the top five expensive queries).

==> Another important feature of Scout is, itâ€™s easy to compare performance in a small slice of time to the normal performance. It also provides an improved development Profiler.
